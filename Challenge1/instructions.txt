Requirements to run the test:
    python3
    pytest

Instructions:

Adding a URL to test:
    1. Open URLList.txt in a text editor
    2. URLs to test may be added or removed from this file, with one URL per line.

Running the test:
    1. Open a command prompt or linux terminal
    2. Navigate to the folder containing this instructions file (../QACodingChallenge/Challenge1)
    3. Run 'pytest'. Pytest will automatically detect test files in the current folder and run them.
    4. If python and pytest are installed correctly, and the website specified in URLList.txt is up, then the output should look similar to this:

    >   ==================== test session starts ====================
    >   platform linux -- Python 3.8.10, pytest-7.1.2, pluggy-1.0.0
    >   rootdir: /mnt/c/Users/Zach/git/QACodingChallenge/Challenge1
    >   collected 1 item
    >
    >   test_URLs.py .                                                                                                                                                                                    [100%]
    >
    >   ==================== 1 passed in 0.18s ====================

    5. If there are any URLs in URLList.txt that are not available, then they will be printed in stdout with the HTTP response code before the test fails.
